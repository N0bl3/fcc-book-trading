Trade books with people around you. Share your passion :D

This app was made during the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The user stories to fulfill were as following:

- [x] User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.
- [x] User Story: I can add a new book.
- [x] User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
- [x] User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade

This is only a mock, feel free to play with it. Create an account, add your books, "trade".

In the future it might include geolocalization for trading with people of the same city as well as Google Books API and social media authentification.
