Manage a Book Trading Club

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://bookjump.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

- [x] User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.

- [x] User Story: I can add a new book.

- [] User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.

- [x] User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

To do:
- [] Use Google Books API
- [] Include geolocalization for trading with people of the same city
- [] Lost password recovery
- [] Nicer UI
